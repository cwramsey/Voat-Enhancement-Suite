# Voat Enhancement Suite

Voat Enhancement Suite (or VES) is an alpha userscript designed to enhance the user experience of [Voat][voat].

News, discussions, and general help can be found on VES's official subverse, [/v/Enhancement][/v/Enhancement].

## Introduction

Voat itself is in alpha development. Many features provided by Reddit Enhancement Suite are already built in to the site's user experience, however there are some features not included (keyboard navigation, new comment highlighting, &c). This userscript is intended to add those features eventually.

A few things:

+ I'm extremely open to ideas provided by other Voat users! Often, inspiration for VES features comes from threads on [/v/ideasforvoat](https://voat.co/v/ideasforvoat/).
+ Please *do not* install this script if you want a guaranteed seamless Voat experience. VES bugs interferring with Voat may be common (or uncommon) depending on many factors.
+ VES source code is split into two main branches: `master`, which is the tested and most stable version, and `dev`, which is where new features are added and tested before being pushed into master. If VES is installed from the master branch it should update automatically at version bumps.

Regardless of VES performance, I hope you enjoy it.

Thank you!
