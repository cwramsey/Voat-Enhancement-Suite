# Voat Enhancement Suite

Voat Enhancement Suite (or VES) is an alpha userscript designed to enhance the user experience of [Voat][voat].

News, discussions, and general help can be found on VES's official subverse, [/v/Enhancement][subverse].

## Introduction

Voat itself is in alpha development, and many features found in Reddit Enhancement Suite are already built into the site's user experience. However, there are some features Voat does not have (keyboard navigation, new comment highlighting, &c). VES intends to add those features and more.

A few things:

+ Ideas and code are both welcome contributions, and will be treated as such (see Contributing).
+ VES bugs interfering with Voat may be common (or uncommon) depending on many factors.
+ VES's source code is split into two main branches. `master` is the most stable branch, and `dev` is where new features are added and tested. Before installing from `dev`, understand that it may be broken.

Regardless of VES performance, I hope you enjoy it.

Thank you!

## Contributing

If you have JavaScript/jQuery experience (or would like some), fork VES and tinker around. If you optimize a module, create a new one, or if you're willing to share some code that you've thrown together, create a GitHub issue, submit a link or self post on [/v/Enhancement][subverse], or just send a PM to me somewhere.

Overall, any contributions to VES will be graciously credited.

## Installation

VES should be compatible across all operating systems and most userscript implementations. Below are instructions for the two browsers VES is officially tested on.

#### Chrome

1. If you do not have `Tampermonkey` installed:
	1. Install `Tampermonkey`.
2. Install VES.

#### Firefox

1. If you do not have `Greasemonkey` installed:
	1. Install `Greasemonkey`,
	2. Restart Firefox.
2. Install VES.

*Greasemonkey scripts are sometimes disabled after installation. Check under the User Scripts tab of the Add-ons Manager if VES does not appear to be loaded.*
